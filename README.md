## 1. Introduction

This repository will act as the official library of Remix (RMX) documentation. The documentation contained within are the collaborative product by the RMX developers and community volunteers. 

## 2. Mission

The RMX documentation project aims to not only provide the official RMX documentation collection in one location, enabling long term guidance and direction, but also to supply the tools and processes needed for community members to develop new documentation and guides; enhancing the RMX library continuously. In doing so, it increases visibility and reputability of community members, establishes a direct protocol for community engagement and provides the community to recommend or develop official documents to be directly merged under the RMX umbrella. 

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Learn

Refer to this repositories documentation and guides. If documentation for an existing topic or feature you desire does not exist, create an issue, and we will work, collectively, on creating it.

### 3.2 Teach

RMX is a community project and we encourage community involvement. Develop or enhance existing guidance, processes, or procedures at any time using the guidance in AD-RMX-001 at any time (or enhance that parent document).

## 4. Governing Documents

Currently two governing documents are being developed:
1. Documentation Index: Tracking for existing procedures and guides
2. Document Specifications and Standards: Training material to create new, registered RMX documents.

The primary administrative document for the remix documentation repository will be AD-RMX-001, Administration of Remix Documentation and Guides. AD-RMX-001 will provide the agreed upon process and procedure in place for creating additional guides for incorporation under the RMX umbrella

## 5. Status

The Remix Documentation Project is in its infancy stage. The governing procedure for developing guides and the tracking document are both still being developed. 
As one example of the documents that will be available under the Remix Documentation Project, refer to RMX-SPL-TP1 which was provided along side of the Remix TP1 launch.
