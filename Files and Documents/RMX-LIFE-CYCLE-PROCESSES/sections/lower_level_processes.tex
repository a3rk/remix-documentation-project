	Some of the processes defined within this standard may require additional lower-level processes in order to be realized in certain industries or by certain businesses whose activities are directed or more specific than the processes defined in the primary content of the document seemingly allow.

	Only the purpose and outcomes for these processes has been defined, and the necessary activities for the processes, as they relate to those found in the parent-level process, need to be integrated into said process' activities and tasks in order to extend, and not disrupt, the parent-level process' outcomes, activities, and tasks.
